PROMPT:
Create open api spec for product management system following endpoint, 1. Create product (name, description, quantity, price, categoryId) -> event emit to calculate stat -> response string 2. Update product (productId-path parameter), (name, description, quantity, price, categoryId) -> event emit to calculate stat and low stock warnign -> response string 3. Delete product (productId-path parameter), response string 4. Get products by sellerId -> response product array (productId, name, description, quantity, price, categoryId, createdAt, updatedAt) 5. import products from a csv file 6. export products to a csv file

RESPONSE:

Hereâ€™s a clean **OpenAPI 3.1 specification (YAML format)** for your Product Management System based on the endpoints you described:

ðŸ‘‰ This spec includes:

* **CRUD operations** (`create`, `update`, `delete`, `get by seller`)
* **CSV import/export** with correct `multipart/form-data` and `text/csv` handling
* **Event emissions** documented in endpoint descriptions
* Proper schemas for requests and responses

Do you want me to also add **async event schemas** (for the "calculate stat" and "low stock warning" events) using **OpenAPI + AsyncAPI extension** so it covers both REST and event-driven aspects?
